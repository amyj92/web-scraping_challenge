# web-scraping_challenge

In this Web Scraping Challenge, I scraped the titles and preview text from the Mars news articles and scraped and analyzed the Mars weather data.

The analysis answers the following questions:

    How many months exist on Mars?
    
    How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
    
    What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? (plotted the results as a bar chart)
    
    Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? (plotted the results as a bar chart)
    
    About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?
